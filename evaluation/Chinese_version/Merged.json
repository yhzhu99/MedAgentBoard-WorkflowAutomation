The task requires analyzing the relationship between the recorded Glascow coma scale eye opening, motor response, and verbal response scores and the reported Glascow coma scale total. Specifically, assess how often the sum of the individual components matches the reported total GCS score and analyze if specific individual component scores or their distributions are significantly associated with patient Outcome (0 or 1), independently or in combination, perhaps revealing insights not captured by the total score alone. Generate a report summarizing the findings, including the rate of GCS component-total inconsistency and the distribution and association analysis of individual components with patient outcome.",

The task is to analyze how the association between a key physiological indicator reflecting patient severity during hospitalization (e.g., the lowest recorded Oxygen saturation or lowest Glascow coma scale total for each admission) and the patient's outcome (`Outcome`, hospital mortality) is influenced by the patient's `Age`. Conduct an analysis to explore if this relationship varies across different age ranges or if there is a statistical interaction effect between age and the chosen physiological indicator on the likelihood of mortality. Generate a report summarizing the findings, including descriptive statistics of the chosen physiological indicator and outcome across different age groups, and quantifying the evidence for age-dependent prognostic value of the indicator.",
